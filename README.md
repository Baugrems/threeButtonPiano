# Three Button Piano
Code Ninja small project - Make a 3 Button Piano with a Buzzer

## Materials Needed:
* Arduino Uno 1x
* Half Breadboard 1x
* Push Button 3x
* 220 ohm resistor 3x
* 1k ohm resistor 1x
* passive buzzer 1x
* M/M Jumper Wires 10x

## Steps for Senseis
1. Assemble Circuit using [Schematic](https://github.com/Baugrems/threeButtonPiano/blob/master/ApplicationFrameHost_2020-02-23_12-34-53.png)
1. Make a copy of [starter code](https://github.com/Baugrems/threeButtonPiano/blob/master/threebtnpiano.ino) in Arduino IDE
1. Plug Arduino Uno into laptop
1. Make sure Tools -> Port shows the board and your board type is set to Arduino Uno.
1. Compile and Upload sketch to Arduino Uno.

## Steps for Kids
1. After Sensei sets up project, play with buttons for a minute.
1. Open copy of code, have them modify toneOne, toneTwo, and toneThree to values between 1 and 6000.
1. Experiment with new values until satisfied with tones.
1. Challenge kids to write a song by calling the tone function with delays in a desired order (or just play with buttons)
